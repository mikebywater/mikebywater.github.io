    		<h3>About Me</h3>
    		<p>I have been working in the IT sector for 8 years and I have been working for the biggest supplier of membership software in the not for profit sector for 6 years. I have hade fairly unique experience within the companies I have worked for in that I have worked at every level.</p> 
    		<p>I have been able to use this experince to understand the challenges of users, developers, managers and now the board of directors. I have progressed through my career by being able to identify a problem and remove it, as a developer this may just be fixing bugs, as the development manager it has been implementing new systems to streamline the development process and as a director it has been to provide better tools for analysing the company performance as a whole and guide the technical direction we take as a business.</p>
    		<p> I have worked on or managed many large scale implementations of or CRM and CMS systems, Swimming Australia, Unite the Union and Cylcing New Zealand to name just a few.</p>
    		<p> I believe in always backing your opinion with facts, taking the time to fully understand any problem you are making a decison on and trusting your staff. I also like to develop staff professionally and personally, encouraging independant thought while also enforcing good working practice and standards.
